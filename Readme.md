# üõ°Ô∏è Log Security Agent - Node.js Edition

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Documentation Notice**  
> This README is still under active development. Some internals and architectural details may be incomplete or undergoing revision. Please refer to the source code if something is unclear ‚Äî improvements to documentation are ongoing.

## üß† Project Summary

The Log Security Agent is a **real-time, intelligent log monitoring and threat response system** designed for Linux servers. It uses both traditional pattern-matching techniques and modern LLMs (like LLaMA 3.3 70B) to analyze HTTP access logs, detect malicious behavior, and take automated action such as blocking IPs with `iptables`.

It supports integration with **VirusTotal**, **AbuseIPDB**, **Supabase**, **Redis (via Upstash)**, and **Pushover**.

## üÜï Key Updates (as of latest release)

### ‚úÖ 1. Documentation WIP
This documentation isn't final ‚Äî expect improvements. If you're confused about a feature, check the implementation files directly for now (e.g. `main.js`, `llm.js`, `supabase.js`).

---

### üì® 2. Pushover Now Only for Lifecycle Notifications

Pushover is no longer used for sending **threat alerts** to avoid overwhelming users with noise. Instead, it's now reserved for:
- Startup complete messages
- Critical internal failures (e.g. can't connect to Groq)
- Restarts or shutdowns

This change helps keep your phone quiet unless something important happens.

---

### üßæ 3. All Logs Stored to Supabase ‚Äî Even Benign Ones

Every request analyzed (malicious or not) is saved to **Supabase** under the `logs` table. This lets you:
- Investigate false positives or ambiguous requests later
- Visualize traffic patterns over time
- Analyze IP trends (even if they don‚Äôt cross the threat threshold)

Why? Because even a benign-looking request may be part of a **slow, stealthy attack**. By logging everything, we don't miss those patterns.

---

### üñºÔ∏è 4. Web Frontend for Logs (Separate Repo)

A modern React-based frontend interface is being built in a **separate repository**. It connects to Supabase and provides:
- Realtime table/grid of requests
- Filters by IP, method, threat type, confidence score
- Visual indicators for malicious vs benign logs
- LLM-generated reasoning per request

This dashboard allows server admins or SOC teams to get visibility into the data without tailing logs manually.

### üîç 5. LLM Tools: Internal Intelligence System

The LLM (via Groq) has access to specialized tools it uses during request evaluation. These tools are not directly exposed to users but are used inside `llm.js` and `upstash.js` to make smarter decisions.

#### The available tools:

- **checkIPIntelligence**  
  Aggregates results from VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB to determine if an IP is suspicious, using reputation scores, report counts, and more.

- **checkVirusTotal**  
  Makes a direct call to VirusTotal for a given IP. Returns antivirus engine verdicts, malicious score, and historical context.

- **checkAbuseIPDB**  
  Queries AbuseIPDB‚Äôs database to get:
    - Abuse confidence percentage
    - Total reports
    - ISP and usage type (residential, hosting, etc.)

- **storeMonitoringLog**  
  If a request looks weird but not clearly malicious, it‚Äôs cached in **Upstash Redis** for 1 hour with metadata like:
    - Confidence score (0‚Äì10)
    - LLM-generated explanation
    - Request details (IP, URL, user-agent)

  This allows tracking of repeated behavior from the same IP over time ‚Äî like multiple low-suspicion attempts that eventually escalate.

- **checkStoredLogs**  
  Before logging a new suspicious request to Redis, the system checks if there‚Äôs a recent entry for the same IP. This prevents spamming the cache and also allows correlating actions over time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Pattern Matching Engine**
    - Regex rules detect common attacks:
        - SQLi, XSS, Path traversal, NoSQLi, SSRF, Command injection
    - Found in `rules/patterns.json`

2. **AI Decision Layer**
    - Matched requests are passed to Groq (LLaMA 3.3 70B)
    - The model:
        - Assesses maliciousness
        - Gives confidence score (1‚Äì10)
        - Explains why it flagged something
    - Only runs if initial match score is ‚â• configured threshold

3. **Action Pipeline**
    - If confidence ‚â• block threshold:
        - IP is dropped using `iptables`
        - Supabase is updated
    - If confidence is borderline:
        - Redis monitoring is used to observe future behavior

4. **Supabase Logging**
    - All malicious logs saved regardless of LLM verdict
    - Fields include:
        - `ip_address`, `method`, `url`, `user_agent`, `status`, `threat_type`, `confidence`, `llm_decision`, `reasoning`, `is_blocked`, and timestamps

## üìã Sample Log Analysis

```json
{
  "ip": "196.251.85.193",
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "/.env",
  "threat_type": "sensitive_file_access",
  "llm_decision": "MALICIOUS",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "Attempting to access a known sensitive file (.env), commonly used to steal secrets. IP has poor reputation from VirusTotal.",
  "is_blocked": true
}
